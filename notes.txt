Essay 1:
- They critiqued existing work because most studies did not specify which (if any) behavioural theories inform their design or attempted to formalise this process.
- BrainHex: in game design domain, which contains far less in the way of established taxonomies, Orji et al. were careful to select a model with independent categories
- series of actionable recommendations for the design of game mechanics based on how each of the HBM determinants map onto each of the seven BrainHex types.
- only gamers: results may not generalise
- initial work: difference in sample sizes between smallest and largest of BrainHex typesover 10% of those surveyed
- 4+ times number of 18-25 as over 45s not considered  weakness, despite successful persuasive health games for elderly [de Oliveira et al., 2010].
- Choosing the HBM taxonomy over other behaviour models such as Fogg’s behavioural model (FBM) [Fogg, 2002] is that while Fogg’s factors are tailored
to persuasive technologies, the HBM determinants are more granular and can be more specifically targeted through the implementation of particular game features or strategies.
- Survey did not collect justifications - reasoning still conjecture.
- Important findings not generalised - survey relating to HBM determinants specific to healthy eating

Essay 2:
- tangible surfaces were becoming an increasingly active area of research [Rasmussen et al., 2012, Wu, 2010]
- Studies which did focus on the physical modality [McGookin et al., 2010] did not evaluate their physicalisations against other modalities. 
- One study [Dwyer, 2004] which did compare across modalities, did so using a di↵erent visual mapping for each,
meaning it was impossible to isolate the modality comparison.
- zoom, relate and details-on-demand tasks of Shneiderman’s seminal infovis task taxonomy [1996].
- Future work:
	on larger datasets to find upper limit performance with physicalisations peaks;
	with tasks which fit into the filter and history categories of Shneiderman’s task taxonomy
	as comparison with a modality closer to physicalisations in the virtual-physical continuum (VR)
- Strengths of physicalisations in academic context to diversify teaching methods to appeal to kinaesthetic learners
[Clausen-May, 2005, Gilakjani, 2011] and students with dyslexia and dyspraxia [Exley,2003].
