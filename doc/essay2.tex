\essaytitle{Critical Review: Exploring Interactions with Physically Dynamic Bar Charts}

\sectiontitle{Introduction}
Studies investigating how data can be effectively presented to, explored and interpreted by users forms the core part of Information Visualisation (`InfoVis') to support users in the decision-making process. This review summarises and critically analyses \citet{taher2015} whose paper explores the use of physically dynamic bar chart as a device for exploring user interactions with visualisations of data, to determine future work in this domain of Information Visualisation.

\sectiontitle{Summary of Contributions}
\citeauthor{taher2015} seeks to extend existing work on use of physical visualisations (\textit{physicalizations}) to investigate how users interact with \textit{physically dynamic} bar charts as a way of exploring and manipulating shape-changing datasets in the physical world. Much of the existing work reliant on use of physicalizations involve problematic \textit{static} models that do not respond to user interactions \citep{jansen2013} and are therefore ``\textit{disconnected}'' from the source of the data when they are created. With the advent of shape-changing technology and tangible interfaces \citep{rasmussen2012}, there is a window of opportunity for the manufacture of physically dynamic displays to help decision makers reason about and manipulate data sets in a non-virtual and non-static way. It is this motivation that leads \citeauthor{taher2015} to explore the ways users interact with data displayed in this mode to understand whether physical interactions (such as touching specific data points) or gestures (such as swiping a touch-screen) or a combination of the two is more intuitive to users interacting with data visualisations in order to solve common problems.

The point system described by the article is \textit{EMERGE} - a $10\times10$ set of dynamic self-actuating rods with an RGB display projected onto it (Figure \ref{fig:taher2015-emerge}). This system allows users to interact with the dataset it represents using a subset of 4 task-sets derived from sub-categories of the taxonomy of interactive dynamics for visual analysis described by \citet{heer2012} - \textit{annotation}, \textit{filtering}, \textit{organisation} and \textit{navigation} (Table \ref{tbl:taher2015-user-study}).

\citeauthor{heer2012} lay out 3 categories in their model - \textit{Data and View Specification},
\textit{View Manipulation}, and \textit{Process and Provenance}. (Figure \ref{fig:heer2012-taxonomy}). In this sense, the choice of subcategories by \citeauthor{taher2015} is somewhat arbitrary and limited in their scope, but invites further research into different forms of interactions with physicalisations.

The main contributions of \citet{taher2015} is threefold. First, the authors present a set of 14 potential interactions
