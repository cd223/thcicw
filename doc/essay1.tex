\essaytitle{Critical Review: Improving the Efficacy of Games for Change Using Personalization Models}
The use of technology for encouraging behavioural change to benefit its users or the wider community is a long-term area of research. This review will present a summary and critical analysis of \citet{orji2017} whose paper explores the use of personalisation models as a persuasive device for improving the efficacy of games which are designed to change user behaviour, as well as putting forward a set of suggestions for future work in this domain of Persuasive Technology.

\sectiontitle{Summary of Contributions}
\citeauthor{orji2017} seek to answer two main research questions. Firstly, whether tailoring games for change to a specific player type increases their persuasiveness. Secondly, whether the beneficial effects of tailoring are mediated by an improved play experience.

To meet their objectives, the authors begin by assessing the current state of the domain of games for change.
