# CM30141 Theory of Human-Computer Interaction (2018/19) - Coursework
- Department of Computer Science, University of Bath
- Deadline:	22 March 2019, 1730

## THCI Course
- Begins with general theoretical concepts then has topic-based reviews, covering research in a number of fields that have seen particular recent interest.
- On Moodle, in the Literature file, two key references for each topic are given.

## Task
- Research, summarise and present knowledge about an advanced topic in Human Computer Interaction.
- Apply knowledge to critique a recent contribution to the HCI research literature.

- Choose TWO topics. For EACH, choose ONE article published in Proceedings of CHI conference / journals Human-Computer Interaction or TOCHI (longer, harder to summarize)
- FULL 10-page papers, not extended abstracts or “notes”.
- Published in 2013 or more recently.

- Write brief crticial review of each article, as follows:
- 1500 words (i.e., 3000 for total submission) +- 10%, not including references.
- 500 words: Summarising contribution of article – (e.g. new ideas, what do we learn?) include references to neighbouring literature. 
- 500 words: Assess extent to which work reported justifies articles' conclusions.
- 500 words: Outline further work you consider might be done to build on article. Begin by future work authors outline, but try to add your own suggestions.
 
## Topics 
### Persuasive Technology 
How might computer technologies be designed to encourage behavioural change for users' benefit and for the benefit of society at large?  In recent years, this question has motivated a range of research under the title 'Persuasive Technology'.  Especially current, in the light of government policy, is the potential for mobile and ambient technologies to 'nudge' behaviour change. In this coursework assignment you would review some of these developments, question what they have in common, and reflect on how a design science might be developed to tackle these questions.   Important background is in the psychology of persuasion and influence.

### Crisis Informatics
This title is taken from a session at the 2010 CHI conference.  Two related issues:  how might systems be engineered to allow rapid adaptive responses to emergencies?  How are existing web systems deployed in emergencies (e.g. in war zones, during earthquakes etc)?   As in all the coursework, the overarching question is to understand the relations between user needs and system design so as to inform future designs.

### Search and Sensemaking
How do people search for information, how does it relate to their current tasks?  The coursework means reviewing the work of Pirolli (he has a book on information foraging!) to assess what the implications are for information searching.  This topic also relates to scent following where users follows trails, breadcrumbs or links between information. 

### Information Visualisation
How should complex data best be presented to decision makers?  The field of Information Visualisation ('InfoVis') has grown rapidly in recent years as designers of interactive software have targetted this issue.  There is important background research in Exploratory Statistics as well as in the Psychology of Decision Making (especially multi-dimensional decision making).  Additionally there are plenty of interesting theory-based research products - see for example the edited collection by Card, Mackinlay and Shneiderman; and more recent journal articles.

### Human (HCI) aspects of security/trust
There are many different perspectives on this coursework so you have some flexibility in your choice of issue. When we e-shop how do we know that we can trust the website that we are using?  What changes our perception, or the actual level of trust?  How can we design to engender trust in potential customers? Can you find any design requirements for systems where trust is an issue, or can you develop your own?
There is a substantial HCI literature on this issue.  

### Multitasking
A growing empirical literature testifies to the difficulties of modern information workers with multi-tasking and information overload.  Information workers are interrupted often, and, further, interrupt themselves by willfully switching between tasks.  Some researchers have even proposed that 'addiciton' is a common problem in our relation to email and other information sources.  How can technologies and organizational protocols be designed with these problems in mind? 

### Social Networking
How does the availablity of social networking tools like Facebook affect friendship?  Does the ready availablity of broadcast, e-communications and persistent memory for communications mean that people are able to maintain more friendships at higher levels of closeness, or does it shift preferences away from close friendships toward weaker ties?  Consider work from antrhopology (e.g. Robin Dunbar’s work on social networks) which posits limits on the number of friendships at different intimacy levels.

## Marking Guidance 
### 1st Class
The deliverables reach the standard for a 2:1 piece of work. In addition, the assignment demonstrates a deep understanding of the target article, and makes novel suggestions for future developments.

### 2:1
The coursework brief is clearly well understood. Reading of appropriate and supplementary HCImaterial has clearly influenced the coursework, and the reviews show an understanding of the target article, its contributions and limitations.

### 2:2
The student has partially understood the target article and its context. Some evidence of additional reading has been demonstrated.  However, there is not a good understanding of the current state of the art, and there is also a lack of coherence in the review.

### 3rd
The student has not understood the target article. There is little attempt to appropriately review or consider the context of the work.
